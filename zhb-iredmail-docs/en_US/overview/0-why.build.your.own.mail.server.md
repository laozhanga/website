# Why build your own mail server instead of outsourcing to external entities

Quote from [Spamhaus news article](http://www.spamhaus.org/news/article/719/a-survival-guide-for-the-small-mail-server):

> outsourcing (the mail service) does not come without costs, even when the
> outsourced service appears to be "free". Hidden costs include:
>
> * Another organization can see the content of all messages. In some cases,
>   the contents of messages are stored on the outsourcing company's servers
>   indefinitely. External access to unencrypted emails poses privacy and
>   confidentiality issues. Furthermore, the outsourcing company may be located
>   in another country and be subjected to different regulations and obligations.
>
> * In some cases, the outsourcing company's terms and conditions allow it to
>   search the content of emails to aid in targeting advertising, which poses
>   even greater privacy and confidentiality problems.
>
> * The organization no longer has control of its own email security.
>   Server-based encryption and authentication is managed by the outsourcing
>   company, requiring end-to-end encryption for sensitive communications.
>
> * Large companies with many customers are often a target of cybercrime
>   attacks aimed at stealing customer data, and some of these attacks have
>   succeeded.
>
> * Inspection of SMTP transaction logs may be impossible for the end user.
>   Troubleshooting failed deliveries and other email problems requires
>   interacting with an external support desk. Support desks are sometimes
>   slow to respond. First-line support, in particular, might lack the
>   training and access to fix any but simple problems, requiring escalation
>   and further delays.
>
> * Sharing a mail server with other organizations can cause delivery issues
>   when a user at another organization sends spam through that mail server.
>   When the outsourcing company fails to detect and block spam, or is slow to
>   terminate service to spammers, the likelihood of problems increases
>   substantially.
