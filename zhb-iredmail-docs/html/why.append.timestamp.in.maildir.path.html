<p>iRedMail will append timestamp in maildir path by default, here's why.</p>
<p>Depends on the tools/scripts you used to create mail accounts, it's tunable
in scripts shipped within iRedMail and iRedAdmin (file <code>settings.py</code>, variable
<code>MAILDIR_APPEND_TIMESTAMP = True</code> or <code>False</code>).</p>
<p>Deleting mail accounts with iRedAdmin will not remove the mailboxes on file
system, so that you can keep user's mailbox for some time.</p>
<p>Think about this situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Employee Michael Jordan has email address mj@domain.ltd. Without timestamp
in maildir path, the maildir path of his mailbox looks like
<code>/var/vmail/vmail1/domain.ltd/mj/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael left company, and your company deleted his mail account. With
iRedAdmin, it just deletes mail accounts stored in LDAP/SQL server, not delete
his mailbox on file system (<code>var/vmail/vmail1/domain.ltd/mj</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new talent joined in, his name is Mike Jackson, and he want to use
<code>mj@domain.ltd</code> since <code>mj@</code> is not used by others. And you created it for him.
Without timestamp in maildir path, the maildir path of Mike's mailbox is the
same as Michael's <code>/var/vmail/vmail1/domain.ltd/mj/</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>iRedAdmin doesn't remove the mailboxes on file system, so Mike will see all
emails in Michael's mailbox if Michael didn't delete them. To avoid this, we
append a timestamp in maildir path to make sure all users will be assigned
a unique maildir paths.</p><p style="text-align: center; color: grey;">Document published under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/" target="_blank">CC BY-ND 3.0</a> license.
