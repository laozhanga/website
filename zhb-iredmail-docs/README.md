# How to translate and contribute

* Create a new directory and name it to the short language code. for example:
    * `de_DE` for `German`
    * `zh_CN` for `Chinese`
* Add file `[xx_XX]/_lang.md` with the full name of the language. for example:
    * `English` in `en_US/_lang.md`
    * `Deutsch` in `de_DE/_lang.md`
    * `简体中文` in `zh_CN/_lang.md`.
* Copy the markdown document you want to translate to new language directory,
  create the same sub-directory as original document. For example, to
  translate `en_US/howto/reset.user.password.md` to Chinese, please create
  directory `zh_CN/howto/` and copy `reset.user.password.md` to `zh_CN/howto/`
  (with same file name).
* Translate the file and send a pull request.

If you found something wrong, even just a grammar error or spelling mistake,
please don't hesitate to send us a pull request or
[contact us](http://www.iredmail.org/contact.html) to fix it.
